# Code of Conduct

We follow the Contributor Covenant (v2.1) in spirit:

- Be respectful and collaborative.
- No harassment or discrimination.
- Assume good intent; prefer clarity over cleverness.

If you encounter behavior that violates these principles, contact the maintainers privately. We will review and respond as quickly as possible.
