# Project Overview

**Goal:** Turn ChatGPT into a deterministic **Music Trend Advisor** for songwriters/A&R, returning reproducible **DATA_PACK** JSONs and **HCI** forecasts that align with **2025 market norms** and a **40-year historical echo** model.

## Core Ideas

- **Historical Echo:** “Today’s Top 40 is yesterday’s (≈40y) Top 40 re-expressed.”
- **Determinism > flair:** Inline validation, explicit norms, predictable scoring.
- **All-in-chat:** No external services required for MVP.

## Deliverables

- Chat-native command router (/cp, /advisor, /dashboard, /datahub, /research)
- Knowledge files (norms, fingerprints, handlers, boot self-test)
- QA fixtures + ranges for quick regression checks
