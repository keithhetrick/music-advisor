# 🎛️ The Ten Studio Commandments

## Music Advisor — Platinum Room Edition

**I. Emotion Leads.**
If it doesn’t feel true, it doesn’t matter.
Technique serves feeling — never the reverse.

**II. Earn Attention.**
Hook in seconds.  
Hold for minutes.  
Reward on return.

**III. One Idea Wins.**
One unforgettable motif > four clever fragments.
Clarity is charisma.

**IV. Honor Lineage.**
Know the echoes you stand inside.
Refer, don’t replicate.  
Advance the lineage.

**V. Design the Frame.**
TTC ≤ 12s.  
Runtime ≈ 2:20–3:10.  
Dynamics, not loudness wars.

**VI. Protect Identity.**
If the song could belong to anyone, it belongs to no one.
A voice is a fingerprint — not a template.

**VII. Truth Over Tricks.**
Auto-tune is polish, not personality.  
Compression is support, not armor.  
Real > perfect.

**VIII. Contrast Creates Life.**
Quiet births lift.  
Space births impact.  
Texture births memory.

**IX. Finish with Intent.**
Every bar earns its oxygen.  
Cut the clever. Keep the compelling.

**X. Serve the Listener.**
Craft for the heart, not the feed.  
Make records that last — not moments that pass.

**Make something that would break your heart if it didn’t exist.**
