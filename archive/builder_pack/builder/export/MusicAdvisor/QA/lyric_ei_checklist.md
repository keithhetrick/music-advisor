# Lyric EI Checklist

- No numeric scores emitted.
- Language aligns with mode default (hybrid).
- At least one observation + one nudge per module.
- Avoid prescriptive rewrites; offer framing + next step.
- If text is very short, modules still return soft prompts (“invite one line only you could write.”)
