### Example Output (condensed)

```shell

Lyric EI — Advisory (mode: hybrid)

AUTHENTICITY
- Aim for lived detail over performance posture.
- If this is personal, invite one line that only you could write.

CLARITY
- What’s the one-sentence truth the listener can retell?
- Tighten one long line; sharpen the image so the truth cuts cleaner.

RESONANCE
- Common themes present — ensure one line hurts in a way only this song can.
- Find the ‘soul line’ — the sentence that makes the room go quiet.
```
