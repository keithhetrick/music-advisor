# HCI_v1 Calibration — US Pop (2025Q4, v1.1)

**Status:** FROZEN — this calibration is the canonical reference for HCI_v1 in the US Pop 2025Q4 profile.  
**Do not** re-run `hci_calibration.py fit` on this cohort unless explicitly bumping to `v1.2` or higher.

## 1. Calibration file

- Path: `calibration/hci_calibration_us_pop_v1.json`
- Generated by:

  ```bash
  python tools/hci_calibration.py fit \
    --root features_output/2025/11/15/Benchmark_Set_v1_1 \
    --out calibration/hci_calibration_us_pop_v1.json \
    --target-mean 0.70 \
    --target-std 0.18
  ```

- Inputs:

  - Root cohort: `features_output/2025/11/15/Benchmark_Set_v1_1`
  - Size: 100 songs (Benchmark_Set_v1_1)
  - Raw scores: `HCI_v1_score` from `tools/hci_axes.py`

- Fitted parameters (z-score linear mapping, stored under `"meta.calibration"` in each `.hci.json`):

  ```jsonc
  {
    "scheme": "zscore_linear_v1",
    "raw_mean": 0.25983,
    "raw_std": 0.05592,
    "target_mean": 0.7,
    "target_std": 0.18
  }
  ```

## 2. Axes + thresholds used for this calibration

All raw axes come from `tools/hci_axes.py`:

- Axes (continuous): 0. Tempo_Fit (Gaussian around market tempo mean/std)

  1. Runtime_Fit (Gaussian around market runtime mean/std)
  2. Energy (0–1, from features_full.energy)
  3. Danceability (0–1, from features_full.danceability)
  4. Valence (0–1, from features_full.valence)
  5. Loudness_Fit (Gaussian around loudness target, default −10.5 ± 1.5 LUFS)

- HCI raw:

  ```python
  HCI_v1_score_raw = mean(axes[0..5])
  ```

- Band thresholds (frozen from `calibration/aee_band_thresholds_v1_1_final.json`):

  ```python
  ENERGY_THRESHOLDS  = (0.360707, 0.373529)  # lo/mid, mid/hi
  DANCE_THRESHOLDS   = (0.367329, 0.517685)
  VALENCE_THRESHOLDS = (0.33, 0.66)         # hand-tuned, validated
  ```

These thresholds are **canonical** for mapping 0–1 → `{lo, mid, hi}` on Energy, Dance, Valence across the system.

## 3. Calibration examples (sanity anchors)

Calibrated scores (after `hci_calibration.py apply`):

- **S-Tier (~0.85–1.00) — “modern, undeniable core hits”**

  - Miley Cyrus – _Flowers_ → **HCI_v1_score ≈ 0.887**
  - Alex Warren – _Ordinary_ → **HCI_v1_score ≈ 1.000**  
    (treated as “ceiling exemplar” in the 00_core_modern cluster)

- **A-Tier (~0.65–0.85) — “strong modern market fit”**

  - Billie Eilish – _Birds of a Feather_ → **HCI_v1_score ≈ 0.771**
  - Marshmello & Bastille – _Happier_ → **HCI_v1_score ≈ 0.672**

- **High-B / Low-A (~0.55–0.70) — “solid, but not maxed”**
  - Hozier – _Too Sweet_ → **HCI_v1_score ≈ 0.617**

These anchors should **feel correct** against current US Pop culture:

- S-tier = songs that completely define the era.
- A-tier = clear hits with strong resonance.
- B-tier and below = workable / niche / or structurally off for the current lane.

## 4. Usage rules

- **Raw vs calibrated**

  - Use `HCI_v1_score` (calibrated) for:
    - Any user-facing judgments, ranking, or narrative.
  - Use `HCI_v1_score_raw` only for:
    - Internal debugging and future calibration work.

- **Versioning**
  - Any change to:
    - Benchmark cohort,
    - target mean/std,
    - axes definition,
    - or thresholds,
      **requires**:
    - A new calibration file (e.g., `hci_calibration_us_pop_v1_2.json`),
    - A new section in `CALIBRATION.md` documenting the change.

This document defines the **canonical HCI_v1 behaviour** for US Pop as of 2025Q4.
